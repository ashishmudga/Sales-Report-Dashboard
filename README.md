# Sales-Report-Dashboard
I am excited to share my recent project â€” an Interactive Dashboard built using Microsoft Excel with advanced features like pivot tables, slicers, charts, and VBA macros. Built a dynamic sales dashboard to visualize performance across products, regions, and time periods. Integrated pivot charts and slicers for real-time filtering and insights.
